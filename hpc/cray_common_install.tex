\section{R and pbdR installation on Cray system }\label{sec:Roncray}

An example build script for \proglang{R} and pbdR on a Cray machine is located
\href{../../../hpc/cray_pbdR.sh}{here}.  
To run it, you will also need 
\href{../../../hpc/dyn_libs_copy.sh}{this script}, 
which manages copying dynamic libraries to lustre space (a relic of older 
machine configurations, which may no longer be needed if you're using a newer 
Cray).

Prerequisites for R and pbdR software installation on Cray machine: GCC, Cray-MPICH and ACML/MKL.

We use following software tools/packages: Programming Environment GNU-4.2.34 with \pkg{GCC}-4.8.2, \pkg{Cray-MPICH}-6.2.0, \pkg{ACML}-5.3.1, and \proglang{R} 3.0.2(compied dynamically). The \proglang{R} packages and their corresponding versions used in these: \pkg{rlecuyer} 0.3-3, \pkg{memuse} 0.2-0, \pkg{pbdMPI} 0.2-2, \pkg{pbdSLAP} 0.1-8, \pkg{SEXPtools} 0.1-0, \pkg{pbdBASE} 0.3-0, and \pkg{pbdDMAT} 0.3-0.
